		<h2>What is Free Software?</h2>
		<p>Free software, also commonly referred to as libre software, is software that respects the freedom of the user. This is not to be confused with software that is free of price, as free software is actually free as in freedom, or liberty. This is why some free software is referred to as libre software; it offers an alternative to the somewhat confusing two meanings of free in the English language. While it is usually not practical to sell free software, there is nothing wrong with doing so. Price aside, free software, at its core, must abide by the Four Essential Freedoms, briefly listed below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish.</li>
			<li>The freedom to study how to program works, and modify it so that it meets your desires.</li>
			<li>The freedom to redistrubute copies to others.</li>
			<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>
		</ul>
