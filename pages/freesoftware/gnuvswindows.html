	<h2>The Difference between GNU and Windows</h2>
	<p>There are numerous differences between the freedom-respecting 
	GNU/Linux and the proprietary Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS. Because 
	there are less differences between MacOS and GNU/Linux, I will focus 
	solely on Windows here, though MacOS is still proprietary. This page is 
	meant to be a primer on the advantages of GNU/Linux over Windows. For the 
	sake of fast typing, I will refer to GNU/Linux as Linux on this page.</p>
	
	<h4>Windows is nonfree</h4>
	<p>The largest difference, perhaps, between Windows and Linux, is that 
	Windows does not respect the freedom of the user. The creators of
	Windows, Microsoft, do not care about your freedom, and will leech money
	from you in any way they can. See this[INSERT STALLMAN'S WINDOWS EVIL PAGE] page
	for details on specific ways, with sources, that Windows doesn't respect
	your freedom.</p>
	
	<h4>Linux is Better than Windows</h4>

	<p>You may now be thinking, "If Windows tramples on my basic rights, 
	what is the alternative? Surely there is nothing that can match against 
	this behemoth of usability?" I can assure you, however, that there 
	is nothing to fear. Linux is freely available and, in fact, is ea
	sier to use than Windows. </p>
	
	<p>One of Linux's largest strengths is its minimal resource requirement.
	I have found that Windows uses on average 2 gigabytes of RAM while the 
	computer is idling. My setup of Arch Linux, in contrast, uses an average 
	of 230 megabytes. This leaves more resources for tasks the user will want 
	to complete. The laptop I'm typing this on has 5gb of usuable RAM, and 
	that leaves only 3 available when I run Windows. This doesn't even take 
	into account the outrageous disk and processor usage of Windows.</p>

	<p>Unlike Windows, Linux is also safe and easy to customize; it is even 
	encouraged. When you try to customize Windows, you are faced with a 
	series of difficult tasks. [INSERT TASKS OF WINDOWS THEMING]. Linux has 
	very complete and easy to read documentation on customization. With a 
	plethora of desktop enviroments and window managers to choose from, you
	are never left in the dark.</p>

	<p>Windows is hard to fix. Only Microsoft has access to the source code, 
	meaning the average joe won't be able to repair a bug without help from
	Microsoft. In addition, the main method of fixing any issue seems to be
	reinstall Windows or install an obscure third-party tool. This could be
	the reason malware is so prevalent, as well. Linux is easy to repair, 
	however, due to its open-source nature, user and developer made 
	documentation, and an always ready-to-help community. Fixing a problem
	is a breeze in the world of Linux. </p>
