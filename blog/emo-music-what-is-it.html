<p>When most people think of Emo, a few images tend to arise; black eyeliner, choppy hair, and bands like My Chemical
Romance (MCR) are a few of the things that you might associate with the word. Emo is just sad and edgy rock made by depressed bands,
right? Wrong. Well, mostly wrong, at least. Emo is a term that gained much traction in the mid-2000's from the popular Emo 
fashion; that is, the choppy hair and sidebangs, black clothes from Hot Topic, and eyeliner on guys. In a way, this fashion 
tarnished the name of Emo music, so I'm hoping to provide a clearer insight into the topic and genre.</p> 

<p>Emo saw its beginnings in the 1980's as a child of the Washington D.C. hardcore punk scene. This new subgenre of hardcore punk
was known as emotional-hardcore, or emocore for short. It had the same speed and grit as its father, hardcore punk, but focused
on more emotional topics such as heartbreak and despair. I don't listen to much of this, but the first band attributed to being 
an emocore band is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvt4Gao39k">Rites of Spring,</a> who pioneered the emocore genre. If you don't listen closely, it sounds just
like hardcore punk. </p>

<p>In the 90's, emo gave birth to another new genre, called screamo (commonly called skramz now). I don't know very much about this
one and don't listen to it, so if you want to learn more, check out bands like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LBNMOeD2gc">I Have Dreams</a> 
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57Hq9U3kwWU">Moss Icon</a> then read 
the pages on <a href="http://fourfa.com">this website</a> that are about 'emo' and 'hardcore emo.' The general idea though, is 
that this departed more from the hardcore punk side of things, and ventured into raw negative emotion with screaming and actual
crying at some points.</p>

<p>This brings me to the emo I know the most about: Midwest Emo. This is what happens when emocore and indie rock get married and 
have a child. It arose in the mid to late 90's out of no-name small towns in the Midwest, and Chicago, hence the name 'Midwest' Emo. 
This genre brings the emotion and topics from emocore into a softer, much less punk-influenced shell. This music
is heavy on 'twinkly' guitar riffs, and songs complaining about first-world problems, though the emotion we see here isn't
always a negative one. When most people refer to emo, they're probably referring to this. Bands to check out include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG9VhC0hiTg">American
Football,</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkFeXjRf3GA">Cap'n Jazz,</a> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jypydesbp8E">Sunny Day Real Estate,</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3kOyzJL7SY">Mineral.</a> There are a lot of other bands
and small subgenres that have emerged from Midwest Emo, especially in the mid-2010's up until now. One notable subgenre is 'twinkledaddies,'
which is a more abrasive emo than Midwest Emo, with twinkly guitars and yelled or screamed vocals. Notable bands there include Snowing, 
Algernon Cadwallader, and Tiny Moving Parts.</p>

<p>Finally, I should explain why bands like Black Veil Brides, Pierce the Veil, and the aforementioned My Chemical Romance are <strong>not</strong> emo. For starters, 
they don't retain very many influences from punk rock, or the original emocore. The genres I've mentioned before are very anti-commercial, 
that is, most bands charged only enough for their records to break even, and did most shows for free. Most bands also existed on no record label,
or on small independent ones that they might have founded themselves. This is very much aligned with the spirit of punk, and is why I consider
Midwest Emo to be an emo genre. The emo of the mid-2000's was commercialized, with big record labels, pricey shows, and well-known bands that
didn't even consider themselves emo. Gerard Way, the lead singer of MCR, even 
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/my-chemical-romances-gerard-way-taps-another-nail-into-emo-coffin-101867/">wanted nothing to do with emo music.</a>
Most of the bands that are commonly called emo are actually pop-punk or a sappy post-hardcore act.</p>
