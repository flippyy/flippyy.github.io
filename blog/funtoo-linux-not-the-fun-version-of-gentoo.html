<p>On Monday I began a three day journey into Hell. By Hell, I of course mean
the scourge known as Funtoo Linux. A bit of background before I begin:
Funtoo is a derivative of Gentoo, the distribution that is known for being
notoriously laborious to install and keep stable. There are minor
differences in Funtoo and Gentoo, those being that Funtoo has a precompiled
kernel available, doesn't have documentation nearly as good as Gentoo, and
uses git instead of rsync for some things. Of course, these differences are
irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, as Funtoo is supposed to be 100%
compatible with upstream Gentoo. I didn't install Funtoo for these edits,
I installed it because judging by its name, I assumed it would simply be
a fun version of Gentoo. It is not a fun version of Gentoo, but a worse
version. Never make the mistake I did, and install Funtoo. With outdated
documentation, I spent three days struggling through compiling and configuring
xorg and my touchpad, with my touchpad never working. I gave up and reinstalled
Arch Linux, and will attempt vanilla Gentoo soon.
