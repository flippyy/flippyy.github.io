<p>People ask me sometimes why I choose to use GNU/Linux instead of an easy 'just werks' OS like Windows.
Usually this is coupled with a statement calling me stupid for not playing Fortnite (since Fortnite
 doesn't work on Linux). The biggest reasoning for me is ease of use and customization. I enjoy tinkering
 with things and tweaking them to look just the way I want them, and you can't do that with Windows. It 
 takes a lot of effort to get any customization working, and that is usually at the cost of security
 and system resources.<p>

 <p>Since I've mentioned system resources, I might as well go into detail on the advantages Linux has over
 Windows in that department. One of Linux's largest strengths is its minimal resource requirement. I have found
 that Windows uses on average 2 gigabytes of RAM while the computer is idling. In fact, 2 gigabytes is the
 minimum requirement just for Windows to work. My setup of Arch Linux, in 
 contrast, uses an average of 230 megabytes. This leaves more resources for tasks the I want to 
 complete. The laptop I'm typing this on has 5gb of usuable RAM, and that leaves only 3gb available when I 
 run Windows. This doesn't even take into account the outrageous disk and processor usage of Windows.</p>

 <p>Windows is also hard to fix. Only Microsoft has access to the source code, meaning the average joe won't be 
 able to repair a bug without help from Microsoft. In addition, the main method of fixing any issue seems 
 to be reinstall Windows or install an obscure third-party tool. This could be the reason malware is so 
 prevalent, as well. Linux is easy to repair, however, due to its open-source nature, user and developer 
 made documentation, and an a usually ready-to-help community. Fixing a problem is a breeze in the world 
 of Linux. Linux is also much more secure and doesn't have many issues with malware at all. I don't have
 any sort of anti-malware (antivirus) software installed on my systems.</p>
 
 <p>I mentioned in the last post that macOS and GNU/Linux are pretty similar and support much of the same
 software. I choose not to use macOS for a couple reasons. First, it's pretty difficult to get working on 
 a computer that isn't a Mac. Second, Apple has a bad habit of being an evil corporation that spies on you,
 and their software isn't freedom-respecting.</p>

 <p>You're probably wondering now, what's freedom-respecting software? In short, it's software that doesn't 
 disrespect the personal liberty of the user. I have a definition 
 <a href="..//pages/freesoftware/whatsfreesoftware.html">posted here</a> that explains exactly what this means.
 I'm no free software purist and I use some proprietary software, but free software is usually much more
 convenient and secure. Anyway, those are the reasons I use Linux.</p>
 
 <p>Edit: I totally forgot to add a link to Richard Stallman's reasons for not using Microsoft products and Windows. <a href="https://stallman.org/microsoft.html">Here's the page.</a></p>
