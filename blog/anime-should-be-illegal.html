<p>People who watch anime are the scum of the earth. Here's why: you see them running 
around with their "Nayrooto" lookin' arms flapping around behind them like they're
paralyzed from the shoulders down. They frequently speak Wapanese, a false dialect
of Japanese, and call eachother "Onii-chan" and "Senpai." They may deny their weeb
status, calling themselves "Otaku," but this is a lie and only further confirms 
their status as weebs. Remember, a weeaboo is anyone who watches anime or reads 
"main gahs." This is not good American culture, and it should be stopped. No true 
patriot would ever wear any clothes made by a filthy jap, especially after the 
tragedy known as Pearl Harbor. Please join me in firmly rejecting these evil 
communist sympathizers in the following ways:
</p>    
<ul>       
	<li>Buy gasoline and burn anime stores.</li>
	<li>Sign a petition calling for banishment of anime in American schools.</li>
	<li>Watch American-Made film and television, such as Spongebob Squarepants or any MTV production.</li>
</ul>
