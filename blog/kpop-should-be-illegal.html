<p>K-Pop should be illegal for a number of reasons. In this post, I will try to
detail the injustices that K-Pop directs at its listeners. These wrongs are
numerous, and detrimental to the unknowing victims that are ensnared in the music
form's trap of lies. Some of these are listed below.</p>

<ul>
        <li>K-Pop causes premature death. This is because the synthesizer that
        is commonly used in the genre actually emits 25khz frequencies that
        vibrate the stem of the human brain, causing intense suicidal thoughts.</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.8satire.com/jamaica-becomes-the-first-country-to-make-k-pop-illegal/">
        Jamaica has banned K-Pop,</a> stating that it causes gayness in boys, and
        makes every other fan just plain annoying. </li>
        <li>K-Pop corrupts good music taste by subjecting young brains to an autotuned
        slur of non-English words. Take note that the issue is not a lack of English,
        but rather that a steady diet of Korean music fosters a disdain for proper
        American and European culture, which will eventually be the downfall of our
        nation</li>
        <li>K-Pop promotes unrealistic beauty standards for both boys and girls. Have
         you ever seen an unattractic K-Pop singer? I think not. That's because K-Pop
         is a corporate controlled cash cow that recruits only those who will be idolized
         by impressionable Americans based on their looks.</li>
</ul>
