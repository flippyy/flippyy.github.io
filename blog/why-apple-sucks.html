<p>I have an iPhone 4S. It certainly isn't the most glamorous device, but it was a hand-me-down and it gets the job done.
Using this older device for a long time has made me notice some shortcomings of Apple's devices that make them a lot 
harder to use. Here are some:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Apple devices don't allow you to use the software that you want.</li>
	<li>Apple tries to prevent users from repairing the hardware that they own.</li>
	<li>Apple's software creates an exclusive ecosystem that is hard to avoid when you use their products.</li>
	<li>Apple intentionally slows down their older products to force the consumer to buy new ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd like to go into further detail on the first point. Apple iPhones are computers, and when you purchase a computer
it should do what you want it to do; not what Apple wants it to do. You can only use software that is approved of by
Apple, unless you jailbreak the device, which unlocks the system so that software that Apple hasn't approved of can
run. Apple frequently tries to prevent jailbreaking of the devices, further locking the user into their proprietary 
ecosystem. I like to compare these things to cars. When you purchase a vehicle, you expect that you'll be able to change
the oil and replace parts as needed by yourself. However, if you bought a car and you needed approval of the manufacturer every
time maintenence or upgrades were needed, you would quickly sell the car and buy a new one; it is your car, not the manufacurer's.
</p>


<p>This brings me to point number two. Apple tries to prevent users from repairing the hardware that they own, and makes 
it as hard as possible for independent repair shops to repair their products without approval. Of course, this is so they
might make as much money as possible by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2_SZ4tfLns">overcharging for simple repairs.</a>
The car analogy comes into play here again: You shouldn't need a corporation's approval to modify or repair something that
you own.</p>

<p>I won't go into detail on the other two points I listed, but there's an important question that must be asked by users of 
Apple products: Do I own my devices, or does Apple? Apple certainly doesn't want you to own things that you bought, and 
that's why they try to maintain strict control over them. Join me in resisting Apple's injustices against users by not 
purchasing products from a company that doesn't want you to own them, and by spitefully modifying and repairing the products
that you do own.</p>
