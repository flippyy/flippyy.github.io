<p>There seem to be some misunderstandings regarding suckless and their
software philosophy, so I'll lay out the basics here, and what I think
is good and bad about their programs.</p>

<p>If you don't know, <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> is a 
collective of hackers that write minimal software meant for advanced 
users. They've released well-known programs that include dmenu, dwm, st, 
and others. Perhaps the most notable quality of these programs is their
"non-features," that is, they are lacking of common features and must be
configured by editing a C header file and then recompiling the software 
with every change that you make. This sounds like a hassle, but because
the software is small, it will compile in a fraction of a second. </p>

<p>Suckless software is admittedly harder to configure and install than
other programs, so why use it? At first glance, it just looks like a
good attempt at messing up package maintainers, as you can't effectively
distribute binaries of these programs. There are numerous advantages to
this, in addition to the disadvantages.</p>

<p>Before I go further, I should explain exactly what suckless does with
its code. The basic idea is that code quality should not be measured by
quantity, but rather simplicity. Suckless prides itself on the low 
resource footprint of its programs, for example, dwm is less than 2000
lines of C. Programs are delibrately written without common features,
and those features are usually distributed via patches in .diff files.
This keeps code fast, easy to write, and modular, hence the Unix way.
the general idea behind all of this is stated on their site: "Ingenious ideas 
are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the 
Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you 
have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the 
more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks." To sum it up,
the more simple you can make a solution, the better a solution is.</p>

<p>Suckless isn't all good though. Like I stated above, you have to recompile
a program every time a configuration edit is made to it in order for the change
to stick. This makes it difficult to distribute by a distro's repositories,
since the user would be getting a version they can't configure. Also, the
software is hard to use and configure in many cases.</p>


<p>Note that suckless software isn't meant for most people. It is stated
on <a href="https://suckless.org/philosophy/">their philosophy page</a> 
that the programs are meant for experienced and advanced users. If you
don't want to edit a C header file and recompile every time you want
a different colorscheme, then suckless isn't for you. It's a model that 
can be appealing to a lot of people, though. </p>
