<p>You might be wondering, what exactly is GNU/Linux? I hope to clarify that in this post and provide
some insight into the history of this system.</p>

<p>You're probably very familiar with Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS; they power most of the
personal computing market. However, you probably don't know very much about GNU/Linux, which is
commonly shortened to just 'Linux.' These are operating systems: the software that drives a
computer and allows use of it. GNU/Linux is very similar to macOS, and not quite so similar to
Windows, but they all generally allow you to do the same things, albeit in different ways.</p>

<p>Windows is based on MS-DOS, an old operating system that your parents probably used, and
GNU/Linux and macOS are based on an operating system made by AT&T-Bell Labs called Unix. MacOS
and GNU/Linux function similarly and support much of the same software, as do other operating
systems such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD (macOS is based on a BSD distribution called Darwin, which
is the Unix variant created at Berkeley under the name Berkeley Software Distribution). While
BSD is basically a direct descendent of the original Unix, GNU/Linux are simply based upon its
structure.</p>

<p>Unlike the other operating systems mentioned, GNU/Linux was not created for monetary gain
and business purposes, but instead was created for moral and political reasons. In 1983, a
hacker named <a href="http://stallman.org">Richard Stallman,</a> who currently worked at the
MIT AI Laboratory announced the
<a href="https://gnu.org">GNU Project</a> , an operating system meant to protect the personal
liberty of its users. You see, Stallman had come from a time when computing was open. The
human-readable code of every program
(not the 1's and 0's that the computer understands) was available to its users, and they could
edit it in order to make it work the way they wished. For example, at one time Stallman edited
the printing program for an MIT building so that the users were sent a notification whenever
their document had finished printing, so that they didn't need to get up and wait at the printer
until it was finished. This wasn't possible with the new wave of programs that were becoming
popular in the 80's. These new operating systems only provided the machine code of programs,
which isn't easily readable or modifiable.</p>

<p>Through the next several years, Stallman and his team worked to piece together a new operating
system, using Unix as their template. They were almost finished creating their OS in the 90's,
but they were missing one crucial part of the system: the kernel. The kernel is the core of the operating
system. It allocates the resources of the computer (CPU, RAM, etc.) and contains device drivers.
Essentially, anything that you see on a computer has to go through a kernel before it reaches you.
A Finnish computer science student, Linus Torvalds, had written a freedom respecting kernel, which
he named Linux. This was added to the GNU system, creating a complete GNU system using Linux as
the kernel. This is where the name GNU/Linux comes from.</p>

<p>Of course, while Linux is used in GNU systems, that isn't the only place you see it. Linux
is actually the kernel for the Android mobile OS, meaning that everyone with an Android smartphone
has Linux in their pocket (but not GNU). Linux and GNU based systems power most of the internet, as they
are very secure and well suited for servers. In conclusion, GNU/Linux is an operating system with a rich
history and eccentric creator. In my next post I will detail why I choose to use GNU/Linux over something
like macOS, Windows, or FreeBSD.</p>
